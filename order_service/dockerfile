# Step 1: Build the application with Maven
# Start with a JDK 19 image that has Maven
FROM openjdk:19-slim as build
WORKDIR /app

# Install Maven
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y maven && \
    apt-get clean && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Copy the project files into the image
COPY ./pom.xml ./pom.xml
COPY ./src ./src

# Use Maven to build the application
RUN mvn clean package -DskipTests

# Step 2: Create the runtime image
FROM openjdk:19-slim
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the JAR from the build stage to the runtime stage
COPY --from=build /app/target/*.jar /app/app.jar

ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "/app/app.jar"]
